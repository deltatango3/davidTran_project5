Welcome to Up Dog!

This site was inspired by own two rescue dogs. I have been lucky to find two amazing dogs and it would be a dream for others to one day have a chance to rescue a dog in need. 

Currently I am showing random dogs within the location parameter provided. This gives dogs that have been waiting longer to be adopted or fostered a chance to catch the heart of their potential owners.

Technology

This was my first ever React site. It was created within 3 days of my introduction to the framework. 

Next Steps

I would like to do a major refactor using what I have learned since this site was created. These include proper use of react-router and incorporating other functionality such as:

Geolocation/mapping of shelter location.
Ability to filter for different animals/at least cats. 
Possibly rearrange to have more than 6 animals show at a time.
Actual user authentication to allow users to save their own unique favourite animals list.
